| May-2025  | Our paper entitled Boosting Time-series Domain Adaptation via A Time-Frequency Consensus Framework has been accepted. This work introduces a novel consensus-based strategy that integrates time- and frequency-domain representations to enhance robustness in domain adaptation for time-series tasks. |
| Feb-2025  | Our paper entitled [Evidential Domain Adaptation for Remaining Useful Life Prediction with Incomplete Degradation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10930593) has been accepted in IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement. This work introduces an evidential learning framework to handle incomplete degradation data during domain adaptation for RUL prediction. |
| Jan-2025  | Our paper entitled [EverAdapt: Continuous adaptation for dynamic machine fault diagnosis environments](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0888327025000184) has been accepted in Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing. EverAdapt offers a novel framework for lifelong learning in fault diagnosis, continuously adapting to changes in operating conditions. |
| Jan-2025  | Our paper entitled [From Inconsistency to Unity: Benchmarking Deep Learning-Based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for RUL](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10839091) has been accepted in IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering. It provides a unified benchmark and protocol for evaluating UDA methods in RUL prediction. |
| Jan-2025  | Our paper entitled [Augmented Contrastive Clustering with Uncertainty-Aware Prototyping for Time Series Test Time Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01472) has been accepted at KDD 2025. This method improves test-time adaptation by leveraging contrastive learning and prototype uncertainty for time series. |
| Oct-2024  | Our paper entitled [Overcoming Negative Transfer by Online Selection: Distant Domain Adaptation for Fault Diagnosis](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10707663) has been accepted in IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement. It presents a novel online selection strategy to reduce negative transfer in distant domain scenarios. |
